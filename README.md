# Cat's Sudoku (AKA Best Sudoku)

Unfortunately, this no longer works as the API has been changed. If I can find another Sudoku API, or am able to create my own, I will update this project.

A website where you can play Sudoku. You can sign up, login, save/load games, and see best times/completed games for yourself.
Global leaderboard can be seen as well.
